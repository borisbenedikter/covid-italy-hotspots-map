# covid-italy-hotspots-map

This repository provides MATLAB codes to plot maps of the incidence of daily new COVID-19 cases in Italy.
For each Italian region, the average number of newly reported COVID-19 cases over the last 7 days is computed by using the official data provided by the "Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri" and "Dipartimento della Protezione Civile" (included as git submodule repository).
The main_covid_hotspots.m script generates a map of the Italian regions colored accordingly to the number of new cases with respect to the local population.
The output provides a useful tool to assess the up-to-date incidence and the hot spots of COVID-19 over the entire nation.
