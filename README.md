# covid-italy-hotspots-map

This repository is aimed at generating maps of the Italian areas (regions or provinces) that show the average number of new daily COVID-19 cases with respect to the local population.

All code is written in MATLAB language.

Official data provided by the "Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri" and "Dipartimento della Protezione Civile" are used for generating the maps.
